The pot is currently at 200, and Mason's stack situation isn't specified, but he is not required to call any additional bet as there have been no raises. \n\nSince both players have checked previously, this presents a situation where Mason can choose to check again or make a move. A check would keep the pot the same and allow for future action on the flop, while any bet would commit chips to the pot. Given that he has a marginal hand and no prospects of strong improvement yet, it might be prudent to check and see how the board develops.\n\nTherefore, the best action for Mason would be to check and take a cautious approach, preserving his chips for future streets.\n\ndecision: check",
