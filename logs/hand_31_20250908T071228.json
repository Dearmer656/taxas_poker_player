However, Ethan has raised significantly by 500 chips, which is a strong indication that he has a solid hand. Given that you have already called 100 chips before and now face a raise, you need to consider whether the additional 400 chips are justified based on your equity and position.\n\nYour current hand does not connect with the board (which is empty), so you need to think critically about Ethan's range. It’s likely that he has stronger cards, and calling here could put you in a difficult spot if you don’t hit the flop well.
