      "response_text": "In this situation, you are holding a hand of 7♦ and Q♣, which is relatively weak against an opponent's raise of 300 chips. Your current stack is at risk, and considering the initial call of 200 chips plus the opponent's raise, you would need to commit an additional 300 chips to call. \n\nYour strategy notes suggest being cautious with weaker hands, particularly from the small blind. Moreover, the fact that Ethan has already raised significantly indicates strength. Although you could consider post-flop aggression if connecting well, the pre-flop dynamics suggest that calling this raise may not be justified given the strength of the opponent's hand. \n\nAssessing the pot odds, the pot currently stands at 400 chips, but the investment required for you to continue is substantial relative to your hand's potential. Your history of strategic play emphasizes the importance of folding to avoid being trapped in unfavorable situations.\n\nTherefore, with a cautious approach, it is wise to fold in this scenario to preserve your stack and avoid committing to a hand that has a low probability of winning.\n\ndecision: fold",
